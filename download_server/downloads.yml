      thereÂ\x92s no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being
      the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone).  But being Spider-Man comes
      at a price:  only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable
      villains that threaten the city.  With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx),
      Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he.  And as his old friend,
      Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his
      enemies have one thing in common: Oscorp."

    description: Dr. Will Caster, the foremost researcher in the field of Artificial
      Intelligence, is working to create a sentient machine that combines the collective
      intelligence of everything ever known with the full range of human emotions.
      His highly controversial experiments have made him the prime target of anti-technology
      extremists who will do whatever it takes to stop him. In their attempt to destroy
      Will, they inadvertently become the catalyst for him to succeed. For his wife
      Evelyn and best friend Max Waters, both fellow researchers, the question is
      not if they can...but if they should. Their worst fears are realized as Will's
      thirst for knowledge evolves into a seemingly omnipresent quest for power, to
      what end is unknown. The only thing that is becoming terrifyingly clear is there
      may be no way to stop him.

      go deep undercover at a local college. But when Jenko meets a kindred spirit
      on the football team, and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene,
      they begin to question their partnership.  Now they don't have to just crack
      the case - they have to figure out if they can have a mature relationship. If
      these two overgrown adolescents can grow from freshmen into real men, college
      might be the best thing that ever happened to them.

      of the gang are challenging each other to dragon races (the island's new favorite
      contact sport), the now inseparable pair journey through the skies, charting
      unmapped territories and exploring new worlds. When one of their adventures
      leads to the discovery of a secret ice cave that is home to hundreds of new
      wild dragons and the mysterious Dragon Rider, the two friends find themselves
      at the center of a battle to protect the peace. Now, Hiccup and Toothless must
      unite to stand up for what they believe while recognizing that only together
      do they have the power to change the future of both men and dragons.

      by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to
      become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for

    description: "Beneath the cobblestone streets of Cheesebridge dwell the Boxtrolls,
      foul monsters who crawl out of the sewers at night and steal what the townspeople
      hold most dear: their children and their cheeses. At least, thatÂ\x92s the legend
      residents have always believed. In truth, the Boxtrolls are an underground cavern-dwelling
      community of quirky and lovable oddballs who wear recycled cardboard boxes the
      way turtles wear their shells. The Boxtrolls have raised an orphaned human boy,
      Eggs, since infancy as one of their dumpster-diving and mechanical junk-collecting
      own. When the Boxtrolls are targeted by villainous pest exterminator Archibald
      Snatcher, who is bent on eradicating them as his ticket to Cheesebridge society,
      the kindhearted band of tinkerers must turn to their adopted charge and adventurous
      rich girl Winnie to bridge two worlds amidst the winds of change Â\x96 and cheese."

      stress and depression for many people. Some of them, however, explode. This
      is a movie about those people. Vulnerable in the face of a reality that shifts
      and suddenly turns unpredictable, the characters of Wild Tales cross the thin
      line that divides civilization and barbarism. A loverÂ\x92s betrayal, a return
      to the repressed past and the violence woven into everyday encounters drive
      the characters to madness as they cede to the undeniable pleasure of losing
      control."

    description: "Starring Eddie Redmayne (Â\x93Les MisÃ©rablesÂ\x94) and Felicity
      Jones (Â\x93The Amazing Spider-Man 2Â\x94), this is the extraordinary story
      of one of the worldÂ\x92s greatest living minds, the renowned astrophysicist
      Stephen Hawking, who falls deeply in love with fellow Cambridge student Jane
      Wilde. Once a healthy, active young man, Hawking received an earth-shattering
      diagnosis at 21 years of age. With Jane fighting tirelessly by his side, Stephen
      embarks on his most ambitious scientific work, studying the very thing he now
      has precious little of Â\x96 time. Together, they defy impossible odds, breaking
      new ground in medicine and science, and achieving more than they could ever
      have dreamed. The film is based on the memoir \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life
      with Stephen,\" by Jane Hawking, and is directed by Academy Award winner James
      Marsh (Â\x93Man on WireÂ\x94)."

    title: Diplomatie Trailer (Diplomacy - official US trailer)
    description: "As the Allies march toward Paris in the summer of 1944, Hitler gives
      orders that the French capital should not fall into enemy hands, or if it does,
      then Â\x91only as a field of rubbleÂ\x92. The person assigned to carry out this
      barbaric act is Wehrmacht commander of Greater Paris, General Dietrich von Choltitz,
      who already has mines planted on the Eiffel Tower, in the Louvre and Notre-Dame
      and on the bridges over the Seine. Nothing should be left as a reminder of the
      cityÂ\x92s former glory. However, at dawn on 25 August, Swedish Consul General
      Raoul Nordling steals into German headquarters through a secret underground
      tunnel and there starts a tension-filled game of cat and mouse as Nordling tries
      to persuade Choltitz to abandon his plan.In this passionate and emotional adaptation
      of the 2011 stage success by Cyril GÃ©ly, the great Volker SchlÃ¶ndorff (Academy
      Award winner THE TIN DRUM) has created a psychologically elaborate game of political
      manners between two highly contrasting characters. While Choltitz entrenches
      himself behind his duty to obey unquestioningly all military orders, Nordling
      tries everything he can to appeal to reason and humanity and prevent the senseless
      destruction of the beloved 'City of Lights'."

      for payment looms, Mrs. Brown must take on the full forces of the Irish establishment
      to save the market and protect her heritage. Her only help, her family and friends:
      Winnie McGoogan, her eccentric neighbour; Buster Brady, DermotÂ\x92s dodgy best

    description: There are a million reasons not to like realtor Oren Little, and
      that's just the way he likes it. Willfully obnoxious to anyone who might cross
      his path, he wants nothing more than to sell one last house and retire in peace
      and quiet -- until his estranged son suddenly drops off a granddaughter he never
      knew existed and turns his life upside-down. Clueless about how to care for
      a sweet, abandoned nine-year-old, he pawns her off on his determined and lovable
      neighbor Leah (Diane Keaton) and tries to resume his life uninterrupted. But
      little by little, Oren stubbornly learns to open his heart - to his family,
      to Leah, and to life itself.

      that make the food and then the bill at the end.

    title: White Bird in a Blizzard Trailer (US Theatrical Trailer)
    description: Kat Connors (Shailene Woodley) is 17 years old when her perfect homemaker
      mother, Eve (Eva Green), a beautiful, enigmatic, and haunted woman, disappears
      - just as Kat is discovering and relishing her newfound sexuality. Having lived
      for so long in a stifled, emotionally repressed household, she barely registers
      her mother's absence and certainly doesn't blame her doormat of a father, Brock,
      (Christopher Meloni) for the loss. In fact, it's almost a relief. But as time
      passes, Kat begins to come to grips with how deeply Eve's disappearance has
      affected her. Returning home on a break from college, she finds herself confronted
      with the truth about her mother's departure, and her own denial about the events
      surrounding it...

      piece to the OscarÂ®-nominated The Act of Killing. Through Oppenheimer''s footage
      of perpetrators of the 1965 Indonesian genocide, a family of survivors discovers
      how their son was murdered, as well as the identities of the killers. The documentary
      focuses on the youngest son, an optometrist named Adi, who decides to break
      the suffocating spell of submission and terror by doing something unimaginable
      in a society where the murderers remain in power: he confronts the men who killed
      his brother and, while testing their eyesight, asks them to accept responsibility
      for their actions. This unprecedented film initiates and bears witness to the
      collapse of fifty years of silence.'
